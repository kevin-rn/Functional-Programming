-- Write down definitions that have the following types; it does not matter what the definitions actually do as long as they are type correct.

-- bools :: [Bool]
bools = [True]

-- nums :: [[Int]]
nums = [[1]]

-- add :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
add a b c = a + b + c

-- copy :: a -> (a,a)
copy a = (a, a)
